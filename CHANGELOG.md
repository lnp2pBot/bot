## [0.14.2] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- Serialize hold-invoice processing with a per-order mutex to prevent the cancel-order job from racing against subscription handlers (#705).

### Changed
- The late-payment sweep now notifies admins of overdue trades before expiry and reuses the new per-order locking (#705).
- Temporarily disabled the communities deletion job while the replacement disable flow lands (commit `91ca64e`).

### Fixed
- Updated bot tests to reflect the disabled community-deletion pathway and kept legacy image-cache formatting consistent (#699).

## [0.14.1] - 2025-09-10

### Fixed
- Prevented `convertImageToBase64` from treating legacy base64 payloads as filenames, avoiding `ENAMETOOLONG` errors when processing cached artwork (commit `55230a7`).

### Added
- Enriched NIP-69 events with buyer and seller rating metadata to improve marketplace transparency (#689).

### Changed
- Optimized invoice artwork handling by caching image paths and tightening error reporting when attachments fail (#695).
- Adopted Prettier 3.6.2 formatting project-wide, documented the workflow expectations, and wired CI to check formatting at the end of the pipeline (#691).
- Upgraded GitHub Actions checkout to v4 and improved community tooling by normalizing ID comparisons, reusing the shared logger, and guarding solver checks with env validation (#696).

### Fixed
- Stopped community copy from being double-translated during admin flows and corrected unban checks that compared mixed ID types (#696).
