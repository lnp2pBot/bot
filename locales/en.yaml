  This bot will help you complete P2P Bitcoin transactions through the Lightning Network.

  Once you start up the bot, you can use the following commands:

  1. Publish your order using the /buy or /sell command and follow the instructions.

  2. Wait for another user to pick your request using the "Buy" or "Sell" buttons. You can also pick other users' orders with these buttons!

  3. Your orders and reputation are visible in the ${channel} channel.

  4. If you are selling, the bot will publish the order in the ${channel} channel expecting another user will take it. You can cancel this sell order anytime BEFORE another user takes it with the /cancel command.

  5. Once somebody takes your order, the bot will ask you to pay the Lightning Network invoice. Such payment will be held in an escrow that is frozen in your wallet, the order will expire in a maximum lapse of ${orderExpiration} minutes starting when the order was taken. 
  
  The bot will reveal who the buyer is so you can send instructions for the FIAT payment to be made. Once you receive the FIAT payment, you must send the funds to the buyer using the /release command.

  6. If you want to buy, publish your order using the /buy command and wait until a seller takes it. You can cancel the order at any time by using the /cancel command.

  7. Once somebody takes your buy order, you must create a Lightning Network invoice and send it to the bot. After that, you need to contact your seller to get your FIAT payment instructions. Once you have paid the seller, you should use the /release command. The BOT will send you the sats to your Lightning Network invoice.

  8. If you are taking a selling order, i.e. you buy sats, you must create a Lightning Network invoice to get your sats and ask the seller to give you the FIAT payment instructions. Once the seller receives the fiat payment he shall use the /release command to have the sats sent to your wallet.

  9. If you are taking a buy order, i.e. you sell sats, you must pay the Lightning Network invoice. These sats will be held until the buyer makes the fiat payment. You must contact the buyer and give him the info needed to proceed with the fiat payment. 
  
  Once you receive the fiat payment, you must release the fund held by the bot; you must use the /release command, and the sats will be automatically sent to the buyer's wallet.

  10. If you cannot carry out the trade at any stance, you can use this command /dispute to call in the admins to bring a solution as third party. 

  11. Before any other user picks your order as a seller or buyer, you can cancel said offer with the /cancel command. 

  12. If your order has been taken and you want to cancel it, you can proceed with a cooperative cancellation if both parties agree. You both should use /cancel command.

  Make a quick and safe transaction!

  In order to create a sell order of 1000 satoshis for 2 US dollars \(USD\) and indicate that the fiat payment is through transfer or ATM deposit, you must avoid \<\> and \[\]\.

  `/sell 1000 2 USD "transfer or ATM deposit"`

  In order to create a sale with a surplus in the price of 3% \(premium\) you need to add the parameter 0 indicating fiat amount\. The bot will calculate the selling price using the Bitcoin market price and applying the indicated surplus, you need to add 3 as the last parameter

  `/sell 0 2 USD "payment method" 3`

  In order to create a sell by range, instead of indicating a fixed fiat amount you can indicate a mininum and maximum amount to transact separated by a hyphen *\-*

  `/sell 0 100\-500 USD "payment method" 3`

  `/buy 1000 2 USD "online transfer"`

  If you do not want to establish a fixed amount of satoshis and you want to buy with a price under market value, you can place a buy order establishing a certain discount, such rate is the percentage that will be substracted of market price when your order is published\. You need to specify 0 at the \<_sats amount_\> field, the bot will calculate the price\. If you want to buy with a 2% discount on the price market, you should write \-2 as the last parameter

  `/buy 0 2 USD "payment method" \-2`

  If you want to create a purchase order by range instead of indicating a fixed Fiat amount, you can set the minimum and maximum to transact separated by a hyphen *\-*

  `/buy 0 100\-500 USD "payment method" \-2`
